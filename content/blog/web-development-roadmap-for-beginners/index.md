If I had to relearn Web Development again, this is what I would do knowing what I know now. It is based on current job market and technology growth.

_This plan is for people with zero programming/coding experience._

## Day 0

#### The Setup

This day we will use to prepare for the programming, that means we will have to setup our coding software. I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it is the best IDE and editor for web development.

## Days 1-5

#### HTML Basics

During these day you will start learning the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) language. This language is a building blocks of the web.

## Day 6-15

#### Styling using CSS

Days 6 through 15 will be mainly focused on styling the HTML using [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp). Here you will learn the basics of cascading the HTML elements. You will begin to understand how Web designs are made from scratch using newest technologies like Flexbox and Grid.

## Day 16-30

#### Core JavaScript principles

Now it is time to add a logical programming to the mix. By far the most popular language is [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp), mainly because it is very simple yet powerful. Mastering this language you will let you code anything you can imagine. You will learn the basics of DOM, and how to edit pages programatically.

## Day 31-45

#### React Framework

JavaScript framework is a set of tools that makes programming web applications easier. [React](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_intro.asp) is dominating the market for some time now. So it is smart to choose it. Vue.js hasn't been able to get big following in terms of job posting. Angular is slowly deceasing to vast nothingness.

## Day 46-50

#### Node.js

It is time to jump on the other side of the spectrum. Let's start using [Node.js](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp) to begin learning about Back-End. We are choosing it because it is using the same language we have used before, which will make learning much easier.

## Day 51-60

#### MySQL

We got the basics of Node.js, now it is time to get a grasp of database management. [MySQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp) is the oldest and robust database system using SQL language. You will learn how to store user data securely, and retrieve upon users request.

## Day 61-65

#### Git, Version Control

[Git](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html) is a way to code while tracking changes in your app. It is especially useful for people working in teams. You should learnt he basics using GitHub.

## Day 66-90

#### Build, Build, Build!!!

You know how to build a website. Now it is the time to build projects that you always dreamed about. During the remaining 3 weeks you will build applications and publish them on your GitHub account, this will help recruiters see your programming knowledge.

## Congratulations!

You are a promising web developer with skills in demand. Time to look back at see how astonishing your achievement is. Good luck!
